This project is a Sudoku Solver written in Java. It generates a random Sudoku board, prints it, and then solves it using a backtracking algorithm. The solved board is displayed immediately after the initial random board.

ðŸŽ¯ Features

Random Sudoku Board Generation: Fills a board with a set number of valid random numbers.

Backtracking Solver: Uses a stack-based approach to efficiently solve the board.

Formatted Board Display: Prints Sudoku boards with clear visual separation for easy readability.

Validation Functions: Checks if numbers are valid within rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.

ðŸš€ How It Works

The program generates a random Sudoku board with a specified number of pre-filled cells.

It prints the board in a formatted manner.

The solver attempts to complete the board using a backtracking approach.

The solved board is printed if successful; otherwise, it reports an unsolvable state.
